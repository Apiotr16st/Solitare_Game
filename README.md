# Solitare Game
### Overview

This project is a Solitaire card game implemented in Java using JavaFX for the 
graphical interface. It is a single-player game where the objective is to 
organize a shuffled deck of cards into four foundation piles, sorted by suit 
and in ascending order. I created this project in my free time and plan to enhance 
it with additional features and improvements in the future.
